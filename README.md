## Overview
### Description
This app will help you decide on the best places to eat, to make the most out of your spontaneous trips. If you have downtime in a random city and want to visit a good restaurant that is also nearby, it can be hard to research and choose the best one right then and there. So, using a dating app style for restaurants, you can quickly see some pictures and basic information of each restaurant to determine if it will be the right fit for you. If you want to find places to visit in advance, you can also set your location to other areas to see whats around there.
